Apio helps in monitoring of Applications. You can easily integrate(see setup below) it with your application and instantly start tracking errors and performance metrics.

2. Register an application on [Apio onboarding](https://apio.in/onboarding)

3. Install Apio-django using pip

`pip install apio-django`

4. Add `apio-django` to your installed Apps in your `settings.py`.

5. Add `apio_django.middleware.ApioMiddleware` to list of Middleware

6. Add `application_key` received after you onboarded your application on step 2 in your `settings.py`
